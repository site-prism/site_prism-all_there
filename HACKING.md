# Hacking setup

To successfully get this gem running locally and to hack on it, you just need the clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:site-prism/site_prism-all_there.git
$ cd site_prism-all_there
$ bundle
```

The only hacking commands you will need is ...

```bash
$ bundle exec rake # Run all rspec tests, then run rubocop
```

- Write your code. Make sure to add unit tests AND documentation
- Run `bundle exec rake` and ensure it passes
- Submit a pull request

Happy Testing / Developing!

Cheers,
