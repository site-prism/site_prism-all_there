# Hacking setup

To successfully get this gem running locally and to hack on it, you just need to clone this repo

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:site-prism/site_prism-all_there.git
$ cd site_prism-all_there
$ bundle
```

Write your code. Make sure to add unit tests **AND** documentation then submit your PR

```bash
# Run all rspec tests and rubocop. Make sure they both completely pass
$ bundle exec rspec
$ bundle exec rubocop
```

Happy Testing / Developing!
